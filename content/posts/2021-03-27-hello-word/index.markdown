# Hello world!

This site is like an open planner and note repository for myself where I can refer when recommend materials to someone.

It is like a professional academic curriculum also, as my production will be posted here.

If you find any weird stuff, it is probably the remains of this site theme as I build it on Xie, Thomas & Hill's [R Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using [hugo theme "cactus"](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus), so please ignore.

This are the resources used by me to understand the R Blogdown:

-   [R Blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

-   Rebecca Barter's [Talk in R Ladies Bucharest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kyYjCVAs0&t=3322s)

-   MonkeyWzr's hugo theme ["cactus"](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus)

-   CradleToGraveR's [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq_AYx874gs&t=819s) about [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) integration with R Blogdown.

-   And [this](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/114) issue solved by maurolepore

Hugs and have fun!
